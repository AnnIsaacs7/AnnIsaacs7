### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student in astrophysics at the University of Minnesota. Reach me at isaac413@umn.edu. 

I am working on processing images of galaxies that have hosted Type Ia supernovae. With this data, I hope to find a correlation between a property of the galaxies and properties of the supernovae themselves. From this, I can refine our use of Type Ia supernovae to study the expansion of the universe. 

I am learning more about using command line/bash and python. I'm about to start learning R for use in Bayesian statistics.
